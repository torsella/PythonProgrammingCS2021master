## Course Goals
In this course students will learn intermediate programming skills using the python programming language and python-related tools. Topics include use of interpreters, the runtime execution model, python IDEs, standard utility modules, program design using numbers, iterables and functions, event-driven programming, interactive systems programming using a model, a view, and a controller, regular expressions, graphics programming using static and interactive drawing methods, data methods including use of scipy and related modules, which apply probability and distributions, generators and game solvers, and an introduction to networking and concurrent programming.

## Installation of Python
Download the latest version of Python 3. This will be the official software platform for the course.

### Installation of Text Editor
Python comes packaged with a basic editor which is called IDLE. We will start our development cycles using IDLE and the command line.
You will likely transition to other popular text editors, for example we suggest you try out Sublime and Atom.

## Getting Help
### Email
Feel free to email your questions concerning the course: fred.annexstein@uc.edu

### StackOverflow
StackOverflow will often appear in the first page of results on Python-related google searches. Members post questions when they’re stuck, and other members try to give helpful responses. Many basic Python questions have very clear answers posted.

## Version Control
Students are encouraged but not required to run version control. Version control software allows you to take snapshots of a project whenever it’s in a working state. When you make changes to a project—for example, when you implement a new feature—you have the option of reverting back to a previous working state if the project’s current state isn’t functioning well. Appendix D in the textbook provides a guide to the git version control system.

## Grading Policy
There will be a lab due at the end of each week. There will be 4-5 homework projects during the term. There will be 2 exams and a final project. Grades will be determined by a weighted average of grades, roughly distributed evenly as follows: Labs 25%, Homeworks 25%, Exams 25%, Final Project 25%. With the exception of exams, in all other assignments group efforts for projects are encouraged.
